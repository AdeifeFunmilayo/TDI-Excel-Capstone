- Reason: Filling missing values helps maintain data completeness, ensuring that visualizations and calculations include all records accurately.

**Convert Abbreviations to Standard Terms**  
- Action: Converted abbreviated entries to their full terms in specific columns:
1. Address_State: Replaced state abbreviations (e.g., "CA" to "California").
2. Home_Ownership: Expanded ownership types (e.g., "O" to "Owned").
3. Verification_Status: Standardized verification abbreviations (e.g., "V" to "Verified").
- Reason: Using full terms enhances readability and ensures consistent interpretation, especially when sharing the data with others who might not be familiar with the abbreviations.

**Text Formatting**
- Action: Applied the PROPER function to the application_type and purpose columns to convert text from uppercase to proper case.
- Reason: Consistent text formatting enhances readability and helps prevent issues with case sensitivity during filtering or analysis.

**Column Naming**
- Action: Renamed columns for clarity and corrected typos (e.g., home_Oership to Home_Ownership, emp_title to Emp-Title).
- Reason: Clear and accurate column names improve understanding and make it easier to work with data, especially in collaborative environments.

**Date Format Standardization**
- Action: Standardized date formats by using Find and Replace to replace hyphens (-) with slashes (/) in columns like issue_date, last_credit_pull_date, last_payment_date, and next_payment_date.
- Reason: Consistent date formatting ensures accurate date-based sorting, filtering, and analysis. It also reduces formatting issues in time-based visualizations.

## Analysis Questions
________
#### Loan Default Rates by grades:
## Approach
To analyze the loan default rates, we used a pivot table to organize and summarize the data, as follows:
- Columns: Loan status categories (Fully Paid, Charged Off, Current) to show the distribution of loan outcomes.
- Rows: Loan grade categories (A, B, C, D, E, F, G) to compare default rates across different grades.
- Values: Loan ID (using the Count function to calculate the number of records in each category), enabling us to evaluate the loan performance for each grade.
- After setting up the pivot table, we calculated the default rate for each loan grade using the formula:
```Excel
=GETPIVOTDATA("ID",$A$3,"Grade","A","Loan_Status","Charged Off")/GETPIVOTDATA("ID",$A$3,"Grade","A")
```
- Converted the result to a percentage format to make the default rates easy to interpret.
**This calculation provides the percentage of loans that were charged off within each grade, helping to identify high-risk segments.**
## Findings
- Grade A: This grade has the lowest risk, with 93.9% of loans fully paid and only 5.7% charged off. This indicates that loans in Grade A are the most stable, showing minimal default risk.
- Grades B and C: These grades show a gradual increase in risk but maintain relatively lower default rates compared to the lower grades. Grade B has a 12% default rate, while Grade C has a 16% default rate, indicating they are generally safer than grades D and below but less secure than Grade A.
- Grades D, E, F, and G: These grades exhibit significantly higher default rates, with risk escalating as the grade decreases. Grade D has a 21% default rate, Grade E has 25%, Grade F has 30%, and Grade G has the highest default rate at 31%. This indicates that loans in these grades are the riskiest, with nearly a third of Grade F and G loans being charged off.
- Overall Trend: As the loan grade decreases from A to G, the default rate increases consistently, indicating a strong correlation between lower loan grades and higher risk. This trend suggests that TDI should consider implementing stricter loan approval criteria for lower-grade loans (D-G) to mitigate potential risks and default rates effectively.

________
#### Interest Rate Impact on Loan Performance.
  ## Approach
- Rows: Loan status categories (Fully Paid, Charged Off, Current) to segment loans by performance.
- Values: Average of int_rate to calculate the mean interest rate for each loan status.
  ## Findings
- Charged Off Loans: Higher interest rates for charged-off loans suggest a potential link between borrower risk profiles and defaults. Borrowers in this category may face financial strain, leading to non-repayment.
- Current Loans: Current loans have the highest average interest rate, which could reflect ongoing loans provided to higher-risk borrowers. These loans might be actively monitored to prevent transitioning to default status.
- Fully Paid Loans: Fully paid loans have the lowest average interest rate, indicating that borrowers with lower risk profiles are more likely to complete their loan payments.

________
#### Analysis of Loan Amount by Home Ownership and Purpose
  ## Approach
- Columns: Home ownership categories to compare loan amounts across different borrower home ownership statuses.
- Rows: Loan purpose to analyze how the loan amounts are distributed based on the intended use of the loan.
- Values: Sum of loan_amount to calculate the total loan amount for each combination of home ownership and purpose.
  ## Findings
**Top Borrowing Purposes:**
- Debt Consolidation dominates with a total of $232.5M, indicating that borrowers prioritize restructuring and reducing their debt burdens.
- Credit Card purposes come second with $58.9M, suggesting heavy reliance on loans to manage credit card debts.
**Home Ownership Influence:**
- Borrowers with "Rent" status account for $185.76M (42.6%) of the total, indicating a significant share of the borrowing market.
- Borrowers with a "Mortgage" status follow with $219.37M (50.3%), showing strong borrowing activity for secured homeownership.
**Least Borrowing Purposes:**
- Renewable Energy and Vacation loans have minimal totals, reflecting limited demand in these categories.
**Educational Loans:**
- Educational loans are modest at $2.16M, potentially signaling limited reliance on private loans for education financing.

- New York: A significant volume of loans (3,701), with 3,123 fully paid loans and 468 charged off.
- Texas: High activity with 2,666 loans, of which 2,298 were fully paid.
**States with Lowest Loan Activity:**
- Idaho: Minimal loan activity with just 6 loans, all in the Fully Paid category.
- Maine and Nebraska: Recorded only 3 and 5 loans respectively.
**Regional Observations:**
- Urban Centers: States with large metropolitan areas (e.g., California, New York, Texas) dominate loan activity, suggesting a concentration of borrowers in these regions.
- Rural States: States with smaller populations or rural profiles (e.g., Idaho, Wyoming) show significantly lower loan volumes.

#### Analysis of Average Interest Rates by Month
## Approach
- A new column named Loan_Issue_Month was created using the formula:
```excel
=TEXT([@[Issue_Date]],"mmmm")
```
This formula extracts the month from the Issue Date column and formats it as the full month name.
- Rows: Used the Loan_Issue_Month column to categorize data by month.
- Values: Calculated the Average of Interest Rate (Int_Rate) for each month, allowing for a clear comparison.
## Findings
- January and July recorded the lowest average interest rates (10%).
- May had the highest average rate (16%).
- September through November maintained a consistent rate of 12%.
- February, August, and December saw slightly higher rates (11%) compared to the lowest months.

#### Analysis of Loan Amount Overtime
## Approach
- Rows: Used Loan_Issue_Month to categorize data by the month the loan was issued.
- Values: Calculated the Sum of Loan Amount for each month to analyze the distribution of loan disbursement.
## Findings
- November had the highest loan disbursement, with a total of $253,222,325.
- October and September also recorded high disbursement volumes ($119,571,300 and $46,301,350, respectively).
- January, February, May, and December saw significantly lower loan disbursement amounts.
- Loan disbursement appears to build momentum from mid-year, with August marking the start of a significant increase in loan volumes.
