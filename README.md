# Introduction
________
## Background: 
The financial services sector faces increasing demands to understand and manage risks associated with loan issuance and repayment. With the growing complexity of loan portfolios, lenders need data-driven insights to guide decision-making in areas like risk assessment, loan approval, and customer satisfaction. As part of The Data Immersed (TDI) team, the objective is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of TDI's loan data to identify key trends, risks, and areas for improvement. By examining factors like borrower demographics, loan terms, and repayment performance, this project will help TDI refine its loan issuance criteria, manage interest rates effectively, and improve overall profitability while mitigating default risk.
________
## Problem Statement
The goal of the Loan Data Analysis is to reduce TDIâ€™s loan default rates and optimize loan performance by analyzing borrower risk profiles, interest rates, and customer demographics. We aim to provide actionable insights that will allow TDI to improve loan approval criteria, optimize interest rates based on risk, and identify key factors that influence loan default, thus enhancing overall profitability and customer satisfaction.
________
## Objectives
- Define Key Challenges: Identify and outline TDI's primary challenges, such as high default rates, borrower risk profiling, and optimizing interest rates for different customer segments.
- Clean and Prepare Data: Perform data cleaning in Excel, including handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing formats. Create calculated columns (e.g., debt-to-income ratio) for enhanced analysis.
- Analyze Loan Performance and Customer Segmentation: Use Excel formulas, pivot tables, and charts to explore key metrics, such as loan default rates by demographics, interest rate impacts, loan amounts, and approval rates across segments.
- Provide Interactive Insights: Develop an Excel-based interactive experience with slicers, filters, and conditional formatting to allow users to explore data by factors like loan purpose and credit score.
- Identify High-Risk Loans: Analyze relationships between credit score, loan amount, and interest rate to identify high-risk loans. Provide insights for risk mitigation, such as setting minimum credit score thresholds.
- Optimize Loan Approval: Detect patterns in loan approval and rejection rates by borrower demographics and loan conditions. Suggest improvements to enhance profitability while minimizing risk.
- Generate Recommendations: Summarize actionable recommendations in a report, advising TDI on improving loan approval criteria, reducing defaults, and optimizing profitability.

## Data Cleaning:
![Screenshot (102)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2fe85595-4460-414b-b115-64e303326e9a)
1. **Remove Duplicates**
- Action: Highlighted all data (Ctrl + A) and used the Data tab > Remove Duplicates option. This removed 15 duplicate entries, leaving 38,574 unique records.
- Reason: Removing duplicates ensures data accuracy by eliminating repeated entries that could skew loan performance metrics and lead to unreliable analysis.
2. **Handle Missing Values**
- Action: Replaced empty cells in the emp_title column with "Unknown" to standardize entries.
- Reason: Filling missing values maintains data completeness, which helps avoid gaps in analysis and ensures that visualizations and calculations reflect all records accurately.
3. **Data Type Formatting**
- Action: Adjusted data types to ensure each column reflects the correct data type (e.g., numbers for income, dates for application and payment records).
- Reason: Correct data types prevent calculation errors and make analysis easier. For instance, formatted dates enable chronological sorting, and numeric formats support aggregations.
4. **Text Formatting**
- Action: Applied the PROPER function to application_type and purpose columns to convert text from uppercase to proper case.
- Reason: Consistent text formatting enhances readability and prevents issues with case sensitivity when filtering or analyzing text data.
5. **Column Naming**
- Action: Renamed the column home_Oership to Home_Ownership to correct the spelling and make it more intuitive.
- Reason: Clear, accurate column names improve data readability, reducing the risk of errors during analysis and making the dataset more accessible for other users.
6. **Date Format Standardization**
- Action: Standardized date formats by using Find and Replace to replace hyphens (-) with slashes (/) in the issue_date, last_credit_pull_date, last_payment_date, and next_payment_date columns.
- Reason: Consistent date formatting allows for accurate date-based sorting, filtering, and analysis. It also prevents formatting issues when creating time-based visualizations.
7. **Emp_Length Conversion**
- Action: Created an additional column, Emp_Length_Numeric, using the formula
```Excel
=IFS([@[emp_length]]="< 1 year",0, [@[emp_length]]="1 year",1, [@[emp_length]]="2 years",2, [@[emp_length]]="3 years",3, [@[emp_length]]="4 years",4, [@[emp_length]]="5 years",5, [@[emp_length]]="6 years",6, [@[emp_length]]="7 years",7, [@[emp_length]]="8 years",8, [@[emp_length]]="9 years",9, [@[emp_length]]="10+ years",10)
```
   to convert the textual emp_length values into numeric format.

Reason: Converting emp_length into a numeric format allows for easier data analysis, as numeric values are more suitable for statistical calculations and comparisons. This ensures that employment length is standardized and ready for analysis or modeling.

## Analysis Questions
________
#### What is the distribution of loan statuses (Fully Paid, Charged Off, Current) across different grades?
  ## Approach
  To analyze the breakdown of loan status by loan grade, we used a pivot table to organize and summarize the data.
- Columns: Loan status (Fully Paid, Charged Off, Current).
- Rows: Loan grade (A, B, C, D, E, F, G).
- Values: Loan ID (using the Count function to count the number of records in each category).
  ## Findings
- Grade A loans represent the lowest risk, with a high percentage of fully paid loans (93.9%) and a very low percentage of loans that are charged off (5.7%).
- Grades B and C maintain a relatively lower default risk but show an increasing number of charged-off loans as the grade decreases.
- Grades D, E, F, and G show higher proportions of charged-off loans, with Grade G exhibiting the highest risk of defaults (31.3% charged off), followed closely by Grade F (30.3% charged off).
- As the loan grade decreases from A to G, the risk of default (charged-off loans) increases significantly, suggesting that more stringent loan approval criteria may be needed for lower-grade loans.
