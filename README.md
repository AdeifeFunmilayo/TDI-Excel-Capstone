## Background: 
________
## Problem Statement
The goal of the Loan Data Analysis is to reduce TDIâ€™s loan default rates and optimize loan performance by analyzing borrower risk profiles, interest rates, and customer demographics. We aim to provide actionable insights that will allow TDI to improve loan approval criteria, optimize interest rates based on risk, and identify key factors that influence loan default, thus enhancing overall profitability and customer satisfaction.
________
## Objectives
- Define Key Challenges: Identify and outline TDI's primary challenges, such as high default rates, borrower risk profiling, and optimizing interest rates for different customer segments.
- Clean and Prepare Data: Perform data cleaning in Excel, including handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing formats. Create calculated columns (e.g., debt-to-income ratio) for enhanced analysis.
- Analyze Loan Performance and Customer Segmentation: Use Excel formulas, pivot tables, and charts to explore key metrics, such as loan default rates by demographics, interest rate impacts, loan amounts, and approval rates across segments.
- Provide Interactive Insights: Develop an Excel-based interactive experience with slicers, filters, and conditional formatting to allow users to explore data by factors like loan purpose and credit score.
- Identify High-Risk Loans: Analyze relationships between credit score, loan amount, and interest rate to identify high-risk loans. Provide insights for risk mitigation, such as setting minimum credit score thresholds.
- Optimize Loan Approval: Detect patterns in loan approval and rejection rates by borrower demographics and loan conditions. Suggest improvements to enhance profitability while minimizing risk.
- Generate Recommendations: Summarize actionable recommendations in a report, advising TDI on improving loan approval criteria, reducing defaults, and optimizing profitability.

- Initial Dataset: The dataset initially contained 9,995 rows and 21 columns.
- Duplicate Check: 
- Missing Values: 
- Column Removal: Certain columns were removed to focus on essential data:
  1. A Shipping Time column was calculated by subtracting the Order Date from the Ship Date to gauge delivery timelines, potentially useful for further analysis.
- Final Dataset: After cleaning, the dataset retained 9,995 rows and 17 columns, containing only the most relevant fields for a focused analysis of sales revenue.
